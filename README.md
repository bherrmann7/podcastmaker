# podcastmaker

A very simple tool for making and hosting podcasts

- provides a web application which generates/hosts the RSS feeds to clients.
- allows an authenticated user to upload new mp3 files to be placed into the feed.

## Getting Started

1. Start the application: `lein run`
2. Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) 

## Developing

1. Start a new REPL: `lein repl`
2. Start your service in dev-mode: `(def dev-serv (run-dev))`
3. Connect your editor to the running REPL session.
   Re-evaluated code will be seen immediately in the service.
